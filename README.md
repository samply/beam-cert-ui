# Samply.Beam Certificate Manager

The Samply.Beam Certificate Manager is a companion service for [Samply.Beam](https://github.com/samply/beam) that automates the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) lifecycle for a Beam network. It simplifies and secures the process of enrolling new beam proxies and ensures the continuous operation of the network by automatically renewing expiring certificates.

## Why use the Certificate Manager?

A Samply.Beam network relies on a robust PKI managed by a central [Hashicorp Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/) instance. While Samply.Beam provides tools like `beam-enroll` to help site administrators generate keys and Certificate Signing Requests (CSRs), the process of signing these CSRs and renewing certificates can be a manual burden for the network operators.

The Certificate Manager automates this workflow by providing:
* A secure web portal for beam administrators to invite sites and manage existing ones.
* Automated validation and signing of CSRs against the central Vault PKI.
* Proactive and automatic renewal (re-signing) of certificates before they expire, preventing network disruptions.

## How It Works

The Certificate Manager operates as a central service alongside the Beam.Broker and Vault.

1.  **New Site Onboarding**:
    * A new site is invited by a beam administrators to join the network.
    * The site administrators generates a private key and a CSR for their Beam.Proxy, for example by using the `beam-enroll` tool.
    * He accesses the Certificate Manager's public web interface via the link in the email and uses the OTP to submit the CSR.
    * The Certificate Manager validates that the CSR is correctly formatted for the network (e.g., has the right Common Name).
    * It then communicates with Hashicorp Vault to sign the CSR, creating a valid certificate.

2.  **Automated Certificate Renewal**:
    * The service periodically scans all managed certificates in Vault.
    * When a certificate is nearing its expiration date, the Certificate Manager automatically requests Vault to re-sign it, extending its validity based on the configured Time-To-Live (TTL). This process is transparent to the site administrators.

## Getting Started

The Certificate Manager is designed to be run as a Docker container. It requires configuration to connect to your existing Beam.Broker, Hashicorp Vault, and an SMTP server for sending email notifications.

The [beam-deploy](https://github.com/samply/beam-deploy) repo contains an example docker compose that shows how one might run this service in production using traefik to authenticate the administrators interface. 

## Configuration

The service is configured via command-line arguments or environment variables.
